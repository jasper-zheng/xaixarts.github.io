<h1 id="about"><strong>About</strong></h1>
<p>This first ACM C&amp;C workshop on explainable AI for the Arts (XAIxArts) brings together a community of researchers in HCI, Interaction Design, AI, explainable AI (XAI), and digital arts to explore the role of XAI for the Arts. XAI is a core concern of Human-Centred AI and relies heavily on Human-Computer Interaction techniques to explore how complex and difficult to understand AI models such as deep learning techniques can be made more understandable to people. However, to date XAI research has primarily focused on work-oriented and task-oriented explanations of AI and there has been little research on XAI for creative domains such as the arts. 
The workshop will question the nature, meaning, and role of the explainability of AI for the Arts. The goals of this online workshop are to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Build an interdisciplinary XAIxArts research community and network;</li>
  <li>Map out the current and future possible landscapes of XAIxArts;</li>
  <li>Critically reflect on the potential of XAI for the Arts, forming the basis for future collaborations and publications;</li>
  <li>Develop ideas for an outline proposal for an edited book on XAIxArts.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="themes"><strong>Themes</strong></h2>

<p>The themes include <u>but are not limited to</u>:</p>
<h3 id="the-nature-of-explanations">The Nature of Explanations</h3>
<p>There are open questions about how much explanation is needed or even useful in XAIxArts. What does it mean to actually understand an AI in a creative context i.e. how much explanation is useful versus the risk of over-explaining, and how can we design for both explanation <em>and</em> serendipitous interaction? How do we strike a balance between explanation, exploration, and surprise? Being surprised, confused, and reflective are often integral to creative practice but are in opposition to the more functional goals of XAI.</p>

<h3 id="ai-models-features-and-training-data">AI Models, Features, and Training Data</h3>
<p>There are many generative AI models which create content across the arts from visual arts to music. However, there is very little research on how these AI models are actually used and appropriated in creative practice. There are open questions about: What kinds of AI models are most amenable to XAIxArts for different artistic domains such as music or visual arts; Which XAI models are more amenable for different artistic processes; Which features of AI models offer the most useful explanations for different creative practices; and What kinds of training sets are more or less useful for creating XAIxArts?</p>

<h3 id="user-centred-design-of-xaixarts">User Centred Design of XAIxArts</h3>
<p>A fundamental concern of XAI research is how AI can be made more understandable to humans. There is little research on how User Centred Design (UCD) can be used in the creation of XAI systems, and no current research on UCD for XAIxArts. There are open questions about how artists and creative practitioners can be involved in the co-design of generative AI systems involving data scientists and interaction designers, for example, how to include musicians in the design of XAI generative music systems.</p>

<h3 id="interaction-design">Interaction Design</h3>
<p>As XAIxArts is a nascent research area with no XAI models currently being used in practice there is little research on how to design the interaction with XAI for creative practice. This leaves open Interaction Design questions including: Which features of the AI model to expose to the user; How to visualise highly multi-dimensional data typical of AI models e.g. How to visualise latent spaces with 4 or more semantic dimensions; How to navigate and explore the spaces inside AI models; How to handle the entanglement between dimensions within a latent space; How to manage interaction with XAI in combination with the temporal and affective dimensions of artistic practice.</p>

<h1 id="call-for-participation"><strong>Call for Participation</strong></h1>
<p>To participate in the workshop please submit a position paper to <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=xaixarts2023">EasyChair</a> about your XAI and/ or Arts research and practice addressing the themes and open questions on the workshop website. Papers should be submitted in the ACM SIGCHI submission template format (<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">SIGCHI ACM new, standardized single-column format</a>) and a maximum of 3 pages in length. Note that Microsoft Word users should use the <em>interim template</em>.</p>

<p>Participants will be selected based on the quality of their contribution to the debate about XAIxArts with a view to creating a balance of topics in the workshop. Papers will be made available on the workshop website prior to the workshop and copyright is retained by authors. The workshop will take place online with the option for hybrid participation where appropriate. Papers do not need to be anonymised (in LaTex use the command <code>\documentclass[manuscript,review]</code>).</p>

<p>Please note that at least one author of each accepted position paper must attend the workshop and that all participants must register for both the workshop and the ACM Creativity and Cognition 2023 conference.</p>
